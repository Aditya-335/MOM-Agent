  "transcript": "Transcript (Raw Notes):\n\nPriya: Thanks for joining. Today’s focus is on the deployment plan for Project Nova’s pilot launch.\n\nEmma: From our side, the operations team is ready to support. However, we need clarity on whether training materials will be delivered before or after deployment.\n\nRaj: We recommend delivering training materials at least a week before deployment so the client’s staff can familiarize themselves.\n\nLiam: That’s fine, but please ensure the training costs are already covered in the existing budget. We don’t want additional invoices.\n\nPriya: Yes, training is already included. No extra cost.\n\nRaj: On infrastructure, we’ll need the client to provision two virtual servers on AWS. These should be medium-tier instances with at least 16GB RAM.\n\nEmma: I’ll coordinate with our IT team and confirm provisioning by next Wednesday.\n\nPriya: Excellent. Let’s also confirm the go-live date. We are targeting October 1st. Does that work for the client?\n\nLiam: October 1st is fine, but please share a risk mitigation plan in case the deployment slips.\n\nPriya: Understood, we’ll prepare that by next week.\n\nEmma: Lastly, can we schedule daily standups during the two weeks before launch?\n\nRaj: Yes, we’ll set that up starting September 15th.\n\nPriya: Great, I think we’re aligned. Let’s close with action items.",
