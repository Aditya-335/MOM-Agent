  "transcript": "Alice: Thanks everyone for joining. Today we need to finalize the scope for Phase 2 of Project Orion.\n\nCarol: From the client side, our main requirement is integration with the new CRM system. We’d like to ensure data synchronization happens at least every 30 minutes.\n\nBob: That’s doable. We’ll need access to the CRM staging environment to start testing.\n\nDavid: I can provide staging access by next Monday. I’ll also arrange credentials for your team.\n\nAlice: Great. On timelines, our internal goal is to have Phase 2 ready for UAT by November 15th. Does that work for the client?\n\nCarol: Yes, but we’d like weekly status updates to track progress.\n\nAlice: Absolutely, we can set up a standing meeting every Friday at 10 AM.\n\nBob: One technical point: we’ll need confirmation on whether we should use the client’s API gateway or connect directly to the CRM.\n\nDavid: Use the API gateway. I’ll confirm documentation is up to date.\n\nAlice: Perfect. Let’s summarize action items before we close.",
