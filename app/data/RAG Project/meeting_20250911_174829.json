  "transcript": "Hi Vera, your voice is very feeble. Is it clear now? Yes. Better. Okay. Also so Okay Hi Ra Iise just give us 203 min. We'll get started. Yeah, Yes, we can now start. So do we start somewhere for me? Sorry? Should we start or do it? Should we? Let's wait. I've asked us to wait. His team is joining. No, no, no, my team has joined. So if you MEA needs to join, we can wait for her. Else we can start whatever works with you. Okay. Okay. Okay Meena should join in a minute. Just an h* Sure. Sure while Mina joins you can start. Sure. Is my screen visible to all of you? Yes. Saes. Ok. Fine. So we'll start with the requirement cost. So so you asked us to create this, this report first, but we created another code report also. So this is the requirement and this is what we have did so you can see all that every new product sales, all of them are showing into the as the as it is showing here. So it's same to say Yeah, same to same but like we suggested you can just highlight the revenue part then those you need to you are asking about this highlight? No, no, no if you go to the PPT, there is a power point presentation also, we sent Okay, one second just open that yes, yes, no focus slide. Yeah. If you see we have just highlighted in a total revenue recognised in blue then material margins in lighter blue. So these colours also we will be needing there. Okay Vishu can you note it down someone? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And we also created this, this report also. So yes, this is a report so here we will be needing the data levels and all yeah. Already and inference. So yeah, I know the how about but but we need the data levels also shown here. And also you can remove this material margin that is the blue bars. We don't need it anymore. No, the material margin is the red one. Okay. No, I think the red one should be actuals. Just check once there, No line should be actuals here the material. So just check the legend there on the top, right. I think just so see the red one is actual in the legend top left. You will see budget material merges actuals. Okay. Actual. Okay. Yeah. So actual should be in the red line. The blue bars and the budget and the material margin you can remove, we don't need that anymore. You don't need the material margin. OK. Yes, yeah. Just and this is for all the graphs which are like this one, all the graphs, the material margin just remember and you can note it down so margin and the colour should be as same as this one. Okay. Not ready and similar for this one also Yeah. Colour colour Vikra maintain the colours like whatever colour we are using the powerpoint presentation especially that colour will be the same as the PPT ones. Okay, so those colour should be set. Yeah. Light blue colour so this way only we need that actual also deep blue. Okay. Understood. Yeah. The colour also should be set. Okay. Noted from the PNL you have created the PNL. Okay. One second Yes. If you can see first of all the serial number should not be there. It should be hidden like we will will hide that and the values are in Yeah. Yeah. It's actually mentioned in dollars here so you can remove that dollar sign. Yes, yes, yes, yes. The time also if you can see that in PPT, we have a note thing written if you can if you can have that plan means a column and this is not Yeah. Can you see the node in the top in the down? Yes, Yes, Yes, Just insert the text box below and put if somebody wants to write something, he means you would write and that would be reflected and if it is not, then it will be kept there. Will it be in Is it possible to check with MEA about that? Okay? May I put up this comment on on the node section? This? No, can you just show that again? Vikra? Yeah. This no, can you show this? So we have what we say is that we can just put in Zoho form that if anyone wants to add a note below, I can add or it will be left black. Yeah, we can have a separate field there but but this note will be for each of the record. Right. I mean you are having it for a overall report. So report wise we cannot have a note, but record wise we can have a note field, but for each and every PLL node field will be different. Right. They are, they are asking about report twice. Okay. That is twice we cannot have a have a note. We can have a note only for at the record level we can have the notes field. So say for example, you have given a note here right over and above the expenses mentioned above. Yes, no, I don't think we can, but maybe in Analytics we can just check if at report level we can just show something. I will just check and get back on that point. Okay. Okay. So become you noting down all this Yeah. Because I'm not sure if this meeting is getting recorded or not. Yeah it is getting recorded and I also know because even we might forget some points next time. That's the reason. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, go ahead with with the next visuals you have created. Yeah. This is all the layoffs. Yeah. So this changes you have noted down data levels, the colour changes all those things legend. Yeah, Yeah, all noted exactly same as the PPT Yes exactly same dipo and the is data levels and material margin you can remove yeah, yeah Will remove that. This is also the same same colour colourings and all you have to do that one change. Okay. Okay. These are all the reports from our side and Minak could you please talk about the creator thing? Yeah, please tell me mean Yes. Vikram M. Sorry, I didn't get you the creator, the new creator requirement. What all the, what are all the configuration make into that created? No, Vikram that we need to discuss internally before we discuss with Arunava and Soo. So we will have to. I mean we spoke about having it generalized right last time. Yeah. So that alone we will just show you with the next call because it is taking little time than expected. I think you can connect with Chatney for setting up that call. So I think Chatney has connected with you. Right? Yeah. You mean tomorrow's column? Yes, just check with Chardy because he's dealing with the timeline with that call schedules and all. Okay. Fine. And so Vikram just actually, we have a very urgent request for our management. When can we have this first draft ready for the visuals? We read. We go go for that. Mina. Could you comment on the timeline? I'm not taking saying you to make it go live for now. I'm just saying like you showed me the version one should be ready, right? Yeah. So all the ones that we have showed you in the power way at least should be ready. Okay. Could you please comment on the timeline. We should get back to you on the timelines. Just allow us some time please because yeah, the MO, he shared the timelines that is required. Yeah, please do that because we have been asked for the team. So that's why it's required urgently. Probably while maybe it is month end or something we needed need the first draft to be shown there you are saying by month end how this month, yes, month ten. It will be better if you can do that all in the visuals like showed me 34 visuals after we the next changes for those visuals plus the remaining visuals if we can just the first draft, we are first draft, it's not the final one, the whole life. Obviously we need to go to so that we are we are getting a progress done. Sure. We will review internally and we'll get back to you the time. Yeah, please do that. Sapna Sapuna if we can do that, if you can just get up the timeline by tomorrow or on Monday, it will be really great for us. Sure. Just Okay, these are from our side and Okay then shall we? Yeah, please. Okay. I think, I think that's it for now. From my end, once you get our end from once you get all the visuals ready and all the connections made, then you can just we can just have a discussion with the CXO because we need to show them the update because I thought they are still now not seeing because it's upgrade. That's all sure. Okay. Broader picture. I want to say to VI apart from the material margin bar graphs, we want each and everything that will be reflected same as it is there in the power point that the thing should be same means that is the implying us on the line the already, I said, I adding that blue. So the formatting is as per the PPT file. So that's the you can say the Bible of truth for now. And like the note and the part, Yeah, you can, Yes, if you have some and if something is there, you can surely come up to us and we can discuss that for some, that is the real time, you know, because we keep up emailing and there only the reply comes back. So if we can have a live chat support or something like that, like for other projects, we have team groups, WhatsApp groups. So if we can have something, we add a Cliq group. I'm not sure why it did not get added, but we'll add a Cliq group with you. Just allow me to waste time. I'll add a qu. Yeah, Okay. Thank you so much. Thanks. We'll get back to the timelines by tomorrow. Thank you, please do. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.",
