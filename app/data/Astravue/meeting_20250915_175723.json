Yes sir.\n\nGood morning Sir.\n\nRadha will also join soon sir.\n\nLet's wait for sure.\n\nYeah.\n\nMorning team.\n\nGood morning sir.\n\nYour video is not coming up.\n\nHave you turn it on? Good morning.\n\nGood morning V.\n\nGood morning morning Sadhar.\n\nAre we waiting for anybody else to join? One second Alan.\n\nAlan has to join.\n\nOkay? V.\n\nIn the meantime if you can share screen with document that will be good.\n\nYeah.\n\nSure.\n\nIs my screen visible to all? Yes, Yes, yes, yes.\n\nWas it sent as a document or PDF picku as a document? Do they have access to edit it? One second? I have to check that.\n\nYeah, I think from next time onwards make sure you share them the edit access so that we don't have to go back and forth on a couple of days.\n\nWhatever the comments that is, whatever they think that either we have missed or they have suggestions they can add it right away so that we are aligned and we don't have to wait for a couple of days to do this back and forth.\n\nYeah, sure.\n\nHave we got the licenses? I think we have the licenses.\n\nToena: Okay.\n\nNo worries.\n\nIs Neena joining us? 1 min? I have to check it's Okay.\n\nIf she is not able to, that's fine.\n\nI'll take it forward.\n\nAlan has also joined.\n\nLetter.\n\nYou can start out.\n\nSure.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nYou can start now.\n\nGood morning everyone.\n\nGood morning, Alan.\n\nRight, Sir.\n\nI from your last email, I understand the input part is missing.\n\nRight? Which input part the previous data migration part was missing is what it meant? Correct? No, no data migration part.\n\nSee, I didn't mean the data migration.\n\nWhat I meant is the product, the supplier to product mapping.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay, that is.\n\nOh that will be one of the screens and we can use the the existing actto database for doing that.\n\nThe two questions sir, one is at the database level we are going to map the vendor with the product.\n\nCorrect.\n\nCorrect, Correct.\n\nThat's also should be editable Know.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nThat that's there in the product database itself.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo that mark is Bikram.\n\nCan you scroll down to the list of product fields? Do you have the product fields have product as a sub field? Okay.\n\nSo it is a sub form.\n\nYes, yes, yeah, yeah.\n\nSo product is a sub form in that what you need to add is no, no, this is the product database is not a sub form.\n\nSo here you have it as in an opportunity you are mapping this right.\n\n1.4 is the product module.\n\nCan you scroll down a bit? Yes, Correct.\n\nSo here the supplier or company name is mentioned as a custom field which is already covered.\n\nYeah, yeah.\n\nAnd then here only one thing you may have to add product subcategory.\n\nOkay sir, add it by category and subcategory.\n\nOk.\n\nYeah, yes.\n\nAnd we should also have a look up to the supplier.\n\nSee that is a separate, that's a separate table, that's a separate table supplier item mapping is a separate table Yes.\n\nWhich will come in the product mapping itself, Sir.\n\nSo in the database, let's say you have an item called tuna fish, Right? And you have about seven suppliers, right? You can map all the seven suppliers to that single item called tuna fish.\n\nSo that is the preferred vendors field refers to that particular mapping.\n\nG Okay.\n\nIf I want to do only three out of seven for the tune office, you can do anything, sir.\n\nThis is a multiple.\n\nSo this will allow you to up to 25 or 30.\n\nOkay, done.\n\nYeah, so it's, it's not a mandatory thing.\n\nAlso, if you don't have a preferred vendor, which is also fine.\n\nLet's say for some items we don't have a vendor which is also fine.\n\nSo the reason for this is when you generate purchase order, right? Let's say we have three or seven of seven vendors for that particular product, all the seven would show up and then you can choose which one that you want to do for this.\n\nSo initially we will start with US-A space one as we don't have a logic on auto selecting the vendor right now, eventually at later point of time we can, you know, probably say look at the last few orders of that particular vendor, see if they have delivered it on time, What was the rate? Compare the rate and then auto create, auto suggest a vendor as well, so those can be done a little later once we have enough data to look up and then do some automation.\n\nNo, no, I'm not talking about the auto selection of the vendor at this stage.\n\nYes, that will be the latest is what I'm saying is what I'm saying is see we have about, let's say about 100 plus products.\n\nOkay.\n\nAbout 100 plus.\n\nThe product is decided by the.\n\nOkay one is the family.\n\nOkay.\n\nTune office is one thing.\n\nSecond is in tune office, there could be multiple, maybe cut fish, full fish, something like that.\n\nOkay.\n\nThat that's a second level.\n\nThird level is a packaging.\n\nHow you, how do you do the packaging? All three decide will will be will be the ingredients for deciding the product code or item code.\n\nCorrect.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo for example, if let's say I have a supplier in Kolkata, I have a supplier in my zag and let's say I have a supplier in Bhanesar or Katak and there are three suppliers.\n\nOkay.\n\nAll three may not be depending on the availability of the particular fish variety or a particular seafood variety.\n\nThe and also his capacity to process that particular fish.\n\nOkay, depending on that, he will say, I'm, I, I, I can supply you to the fish, I can, I can supply you what you call octopus or something like that.\n\nSo this mapping has to be done at the at the first stage itself.\n\nOkay.\n\nThen see, suppose when I get an order for a tuna fish, it will only show you the suppliers who are capable of supplying the tuna fish, not rest of them.\n\nCorrect.\n\nThat is how the system will be designed.\n\nSo the moment you tuna fish, it will only show the suppliers which are mapped to the tuna fish.\n\nCorrect.\n\nOkay, now it will.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nAlright sir.\n\nRight.\n\nAny other questions on this Sir? Ranachan and George? It's Okay to this level Sir.\n\nYeah, questions.\n\nOkay.\n\nRight, Okay we can proceed.\n\nRangach Chan and George.\n\nNo, no, nothing from myself Sir.\n\nSo far so good by going forward will know.\n\nOkay, Vikome, can you scroll down to the dates part? Okay.\n\nSo we were supposed to start the configurations today.\n\nCorrect.\n\nSo for the configuration, we have the list of fields.\n\nWe have the list of data type and other things.\n\nYou can add it with sample data.\n\nYou also know what workflow, automations and other things to be set up etc.\n\nRight? So I, I think the module setup alone shouldn't take a week, right? I would suggest we wrap it up by Wednesday, have another call on Thursday to ensure with some sample data, you ask them if all the fields are correct, right? So just for the fields, you can send it to them parallelly and on the Thursday call, look at the all the workflow automation that you need and if you have any questions on that, ensure you ask that on the Thursday call, right? So that we are able to parallelly update them on what's happening and make sure we finish it by the time we agree.\n\nAnd I think we also need the roles and responsibilities here.\n\nIf you have this, Yes, sir, No, I just wanted to ask have you received the customer master, the vendor master, product master and product mapping master? These four masters are important.\n\nYes, sir, to start even.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nSo we will share the data.\n\nSo once we configure the fields which by Wednesday we will finish it on the Thursday call.\n\nWhat we would give you is the format that we need the data, right? So we don't have a large data, we have maximum of 100 in each of these in terms of customers, vendors, products etc, products could be more, but customer vendors and other things are less, right? So once We Share that data with you, so you have time as per the this thing, we the migration is only going to happen in mid of October.\n\nSo you have about two to three weeks to collect this data.\n\nIf you can give us the data by the end of this month, it will be good for us to do the internal UAT also with some sample data and then share it with you for your U.\n\nOkay.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo just one suggestion here, the data migration should come post UAT background.\n\nIt shouldn't come before UAV.\n\nSo we configure it, we test it, give them to test it, incorporate all the feedbacks including fields and other things.\n\nOnce that is done and the UAV is done, then you import the clear up the test data, import the live data, then train the team and then go like So I think that dates are aligned with the items are swapped, right? So the UID should happen first and the data migration should happen next.\n\nEnsure that alone please and you create a collection link and share it with them so that they can drop, They can refer to our templates that we're giving and they can drop it in the files whenever they are ready, right.\n\nAvoid transferring it back and forth via emails, right.\n\nSo Analytics, we will discuss once the UIT is done.\n\nRight now let's see the data, let's see have some transactions then we'll have a better clarity on the Analytics which is Okay.\n\nAny questions? Sandhya BAL Beckram Meena, I have two question.\n\nYes, as question is for Bala sir.\n\nThey are using the APPT right now.\n\nSo can we have the access to appto data? I think it can be downloaded and given this, George has to confirm this.\n\nYeah.\n\nData can be given sir.\n\nNot an issue.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah, my, my suggestion, my suggestion is either George or Tajan.\n\nKindly share the download, the customer data, vendor data, product data and the product and supplier product mapping these four tables.\n\nOkay.\n\nKindly download and maybe you can share it with me.\n\nI will like you have, I will also share it with the team.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay.\n\nOkay, another person that so Blue Water currently using their CRM right now.\n\nSo can we can we use the CRM as a sandbox or anything something like that.\n\nI just need the partition.\n\nI think the entire implementation can be done in sandbox itself.\n\nLike just allocate 23 days in your migration plan.\n\nI mean Golve plan to move it from sandbox to production.\n\nOkay.\n\nI will update it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo and while you're doing the Golve, you know, migration from UA to production, make sure you have that team on call to understand the disputes.\n\nFor example, let's say there was a field already.\n\nDo we need it or do we delete it or do we hide it so that we don't miss any past data or notes etc, Right? So just ensure that you do it over a call with them.\n\nOkay? Sure? Anything else? I don't have any questions? Yeah, No questions.\n\nI have a couple of points to ensure.\n\nSo have you given them access to our Zoho Projects to see the dashboard on the progress and everything etc? I have to state that, Yeah, so do that.\n\nSo our action items will be one.\n\nCreate a collection request, first foremost, update the document, right? Send it to them for suing.\n\nNumber two, create the collection request, mail them the collection request and number three, create the Zoho Projects, ensure you add them to their email, give them the access so that they would see the updates.\n\nWe don't have to, you know, keep on updating them.\n\nThey should be kept in dark.\n\nSo as and when you create the list of tasks and other things that once it's done, they should be able to see it right? And ensure the tasks are created with the deadline that is agreed in the plan, right? In case, if you need any data from them or you need testing feedback from them, create a task and assign it to them so that they are also notified about the task.\n\nOkay.\n\nSure.\n\nRight.\n\nAnd what happened to the Cliq group? Were you able to create the Cliq group in cross DC? I think all of them are in the that it.\n\nYeah.\n\nCLI, I have accepted one more thing, George before downloading.\n\nYeah.\n\nJust show Vikram and let him go through it.\n\nYeah.\n\nSure.\n\nYou download.\n\nYeah.\n\nAdd me to the Cliq group as well.\n\nPlease.\n\nOkay.\n\nMeena? Any questions from your side? No, Radha? Sorry, I joined little GIT.\n\nI will go for the recording.\n\nNo worries.\n\nThank you.\n\nAlright sir.\n\nThank you so much.\n\nAnd again what time can we connect on Thursday? Sir? Thursday maybe around eleven.\n\nYeah.\n\nWorks for us.\n\nWorks for pick up sea.\n\nOkay, Meena, Does that work for you?
